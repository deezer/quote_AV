Either a body absorbs light, or\nit reflects or refracts it, or does all these things. If it neither\nreflects nor refracts nor absorbs light, it cannot of itself be\nvisible. You see an opaque red box, for instance, because the colour\nabsorbs some of the light and reflects the rest, all the red part of\nthe light, to you. If it did not absorb any particular part of the\nlight, but reflected it all, then it would be a shining white box.\nSilver! A diamond box would neither absorb much of the light nor\nreflect much from the general surface, but just here and there where\nthe surfaces were favourable the light would be reflected and\nrefracted, so that you would get a brilliant appearance of flashing\nreflections and translucencies a sort of skeleton of light. A glass box\nwould not be so brilliant, nor so clearly visible, as a diamond box,\nbecause there would be less refraction and reflection. See that? From\ncertain points of view you would see quite clearly through it. Some\nkinds of glass would be more visible than others, a box of flint glass\nwould be brighter than a box of ordinary window glass. A box of very\nthin common glass would be hard to see in a bad light, because it would\nabsorb hardly any light and refract and reflect very little. And if you\nput a sheet of common white glass in water, still more if you put it in\nsome denser liquid than water, it would vanish almost altogether,\nbecause light passing from water to glass is only slightly refracted or\nreflected or indeed affected in any way.

Mrs.\nInglethorp had no stamps in her desk. We know this, because later she\nasked Dorcas to bring her some. Now in the opposite corner of the room\nstood her husband's desk   locked. She was anxious to find some stamps,\nand, according to my theory, she tried her own keys in the desk. That\none of them fitted I know. She therefore opened the desk, and in\nsearching for the stamps she came across something else   that slip of\npaper which Dorcas saw in her hand, and which assuredly was never meant\nfor Mrs. Inglethorp's eyes.

She thought\nthat Mrs. Inglethorp was shielding her stepson. Now Mrs. Cavendish is a\nvery resolute woman, and, behind her mask of reserve, she was madly\njealous of her husband.

Lodging as I did in\nBond Street, there was hardly a day in which I did not catch a glimpse\nof one or other of you; and nothing but the most constant watchfulness\non my side, a most invariably prevailing desire to keep out of your\nsight, could have separated us so long. I avoided the Middletons as\nmuch as possible, as well as everybody else who was likely to prove an\nacquaintance in common. Not aware of their being in town, however, I\nblundered on Sir John, I believe, the first day of his coming, and the\nday after I had called at Mrs. Jennings s.

I tried but could not frame a sentence.\nBut I thought of her, I believe, every moment of the day. If you _can_\npity me, Miss Dashwood, pity my situation as it was _then_. With my\nhead and heart full of your sister, I was forced to play the happy\nlover to another woman! Those three or four weeks were worse than all.\nWell, at last, as I need not tell you, you were forced on me; and what\na sweet figure I cut! what an evening of agony it was! Marianne,\nbeautiful as an angel on one side, calling me Willoughby in such a\ntone!

I ran away from you all as soon as I could; but not\nbefore I had seen Marianne s sweet face as white as death. _That_ was\nthe last, last look I ever had of her; the last manner in which she\nappeared to me. It was a horrid sight! yet when I thought of her to-day\nas really dying, it was a kind of comfort to me to imagine that I knew\nexactly how she would appear to those, who saw her last in this world.\nShe was before me, constantly before me, as I travelled, in the same\nlook and hue.\"\n\nA short pause of mutual thoughtfulness succeeded.

It was Romeo and Juliet. I\nmust admit that I was rather annoyed at the idea of seeing Shakespeare\ndone in such a wretched hole of a place. Still, I felt interested, in a\nsort of way. At any rate, I determined to wait for the first act. There\nwas a dreadful orchestra, presided over by a young Hebrew who sat at a\ncracked piano, that nearly drove me away, but at last the drop-scene\nwas drawn up and the play began. Romeo was a stout elderly gentleman,\nwith corked eyebrows, a husky tragedy voice, and a figure like a\nbeer-barrel. Mercutio was almost as bad. He was played by the\nlow-comedian, who had introduced gags of his own and was on most\nfriendly terms with the pit. They were both as grotesque as the\nscenery, and that looked as if it had come out of a country-booth. But\nJuliet! Harry, imagine a girl, hardly seventeen years of age, with a\nlittle, flowerlike face, a small Greek head with plaited coils of\ndark-brown hair, eyes that were violet wells of passion, lips that were\nlike the petals of a rose. She was the loveliest thing I had ever seen\nin my life. You said to me once that pathos left you unmoved, but that\nbeauty, mere beauty, could fill your eyes with tears. I tell you,\nHarry, I could hardly see this girl for the mist of tears that came\nacross me. And her voice I never heard such a voice. It was very low at\nfirst, with deep mellow notes that seemed to fall singly upon one s\near. Then it became a little louder, and sounded like a flute or a\ndistant hautboy. In the garden-scene it had all the tremulous ecstasy\nthat one hears just before dawn when nightingales are singing. There\nwere moments, later on, when it had the wild passion of violins. You\nknow how a voice can stir one. Your voice and the voice of Sibyl Vane\nare two things that I shall never forget. When I close my eyes, I hear\nthem, and each of them says something different. I don t know which to\nfollow. Why should I not love her? Harry, I do love her. She is\neverything to me in life. Night after night I go to see her play. One\nevening she is Rosalind, and the next evening she is Imogen. I have\nseen her die in the gloom of an Italian tomb, sucking the poison from\nher lover s lips. I have watched her wandering through the forest of\nArden, disguised as a pretty boy in hose and doublet and dainty cap.\nShe has been mad, and has come into the presence of a guilty king, and\ngiven him rue to wear and bitter herbs to taste of. She has been\ninnocent, and the black hands of jealousy have crushed her reedlike\nthroat. I have seen her in every age and in every costume. Ordinary\nwomen never appeal to one s imagination. They are limited to their\ncentury. No glamour ever transfigures them. One knows their minds as\neasily as one knows their bonnets. One can always find them. There is\nno mystery in any of them. They ride in the park in the morning and\nchatter at tea-parties in the afternoon. They have their stereotyped\nsmile and their fashionable manner. They are quite obvious. But an\nactress!

But it _was_ said, I know, very well, and by more\nthan one; for Miss Godby told Miss Sparks, that nobody in their senses\ncould expect Mr. Ferrars to give up a woman like Miss Morton, with\nthirty thousand pounds to her fortune, for Lucy Steele that had nothing\nat all; and I had it from Miss Sparks myself. And besides that, my\ncousin Richard said himself, that when it came to the point he was\nafraid Mr. Ferrars would be off; and when Edward did not come near us\nfor three days, I could not tell what to think myself; and I believe in\nmy heart Lucy gave it up all for lost; for we came away from your\nbrother s Wednesday, and we saw nothing of him not all Thursday,\nFriday, and Saturday, and did not know what was become of him. Once\nLucy thought to write to him, but then her spirits rose against that.\nHowever this morning he came just as we came home from church; and then\nit all came out, how he had been sent for Wednesday to Harley Street,\nand been talked to by his mother and all of them, and how he had\ndeclared before them all that he loved nobody but Lucy, and nobody but\nLucy would he have. And how he had been so worried by what passed, that\nas soon as he had went away from his mother s house, he had got upon\nhis horse, and rid into the country, some where or other; and how he\nhad stayed about at an inn all Thursday and Friday, on purpose to get\nthe better of it. And after thinking it all over and over again, he\nsaid, it seemed to him as if, now he had no fortune, and no nothing at\nall, it would be quite unkind to keep her on to the engagement, because\nit must be for her loss, for he had nothing but two thousand pounds,\nand no hope of any thing else; and if he was to go into orders, as he\nhad some thoughts, he could get nothing but a curacy, and how was they\nto live upon that? He could not bear to think of her doing no better,\nand so he begged, if she had the least mind for it, to put an end to\nthe matter directly, and leave him shift for himself. I heard him say\nall this as plain as could possibly be. And it was entirely for _her_\nsake, and upon _her_ account, that he said a word about being off, and\nnot upon his own. I will take my oath he never dropt a syllable of\nbeing tired of her, or of wishing to marry Miss Morton, or any thing\nlike it. But, to be sure, Lucy would not give ear to such kind of\ntalking; so she told him directly (with a great deal about sweet and\nlove, you know, and all that Oh, la! one can t repeat such kind of\nthings you know) she told him directly, she had not the least mind in\nthe world to be off, for she could live with him upon a trifle, and how\nlittle so ever he might have, she should be very glad to have it all,\nyou know, or something of the kind. So then he was monstrous happy, and\ntalked on some time about what they should do, and they agreed he\nshould take orders directly, and they must wait to be married till he\ngot a living. And just then I could not hear any more, for my cousin\ncalled from below to tell me Mrs. Richardson was come in her coach, and\nwould take one of us to Kensington Gardens; so I was forced to go into\nthe room and interrupt them, to ask Lucy if she would like to go, but\nshe did not care to leave Edward; so I just run up stairs and put on a\npair of silk stockings and came off with the Richardsons.\"\n\n\"I do not understand what you mean by interrupting them,\" said Elinor;", "label": 0}, {"text": ", upon which Rodney\nheld up his hand, containing his manuscript, without saying anything\nexcept \"If you like.\"\n\nDenham took the manuscript and went.
