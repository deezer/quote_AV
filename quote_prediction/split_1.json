Ever prone to magnify Fate, George counted up the\nforces that had swept him into this contentment.\n\n\"Anything good in Freddy's letter?\"\n\n\"Not yet.\"\n\nHis own content was absolute, but hers held bitterness: the\nHoneychurches had not forgiven them; they were disgusted at her past\nhypocrisy; she had alienated Windy Corner, perhaps for ever.\n\n\"What does he say?\"", "\n\nThey murmured, \"Right you are, Burra Sahib. . . .

Any native who plays polo is all right.\nWhat you've got to stamp on is these educated classes, and, mind,\nI do know what I'm talking about this time.\"\n\nThe smoking-room door opened, and let in a feminine buzz. Mrs.\nTurton called out, \"She's better,\" and from both sections of the\ncommunity a sigh of joy and relief rose. The Civil Surgeon, who\nhad brought the good news, came in.", "and am I good and is he bad\nand are we saved? . . . and ending everything the echo.\"\n\n\"I don't hear it so much,\" said Adela, moving towards her. \"You\nsend it away, you do nothing but good, you are so good.\"\n\n\"I am not good, no, bad.\" She spoke more calmly and resumed her\ncards, saying as she turned them up, \"A bad old woman, bad, bad,\ndetestable.

It is hard when a person you have classed as\ntypically British speaks out of his character.\n\n\"He was not driving us well,\" she said. \"He jolted us.\"\n\n\"That I deny.

He could not prevent himself, when alone, from\nrehearsing over and over in his mind all that had happened since\nBeaver's visit to Hetton; searching for clues he had missed at the time;\nwondering where something he had said or done might have changed the\ncourse of events; going back further to his earliest acquaintance with\nBrenda to find indications that should have made him more ready to\nunderstand the change that had come over her; reliving scene after scene\nin the last eight years of his life.", "On seeing the City Magistrate alone with a\nmaiden at twilight, he had borne down on them with hospitable\nintent. He had a new little car, and wished to place it at their\ndisposal; the City Magistrate would decide whether the offer was\nacceptable.\n\nRonny was by this time rather ashamed of his curtness to Aziz and\nGodbole, and here was an opportunity of showing that he could treat\nIndians with consideration when they deserved it.

I might not have been so amiable if I'd\nknown.\"\n\n\"No, darling, that's why.\"\n\nHalf the house party wondered why Beaver was there; the other half knew.\nAs a result of this he and Brenda saw each other very little, less than\nif they had been casual acquaintances, so that Angela remarked to her\nhusband, \"I daresay it was a mistake to ask him.", "\n\nSuddenly she laughed; surely one ought to laugh.

When he said \"of course there are exceptions\" he was\nquoting Mr. Turton, while \"increasing the izzat\" was Major\nCallendar's own.

But before\nhe left Tunbridge Wells he made a remark to the vicar, which he now\nmade to Lucy herself when she closed the little piano and moved dreamily\ntowards him:\n\n\"If Miss Honeychurch ever takes to live as she plays, it will be very\nexciting both for us and for her.\"\n\nLucy at once re-entered daily life.\n\n\"Oh, what a funny thing!

It was long ere they returned to Miss Bartlett,\nbut when they did her behaviour seemed more interesting. George, who\ndisliked any darkness, said: \"It's clear that she knew. Then, why\ndid she risk the meeting? She knew he was there, and yet she went to\nchurch.\"\n\nThey tried to piece the thing together.\n\nAs they talked, an incredible solution came into Lucy's mind. She\nrejected it, and said: \"How like Charlotte to undo her work by a feeble\nmuddle at the last moment.\"", "\n\n\"Very well, but your life must continue a poor man's; no holidays\nin Kashmir for you yet, you must stick to your profession and rise\nto a highly paid post, not retire to a jungle-state and write\npoems.

The approach is prosaic. \"Excellent,\" said Aziz,\npatting a stout shoulder and thinking, \"I wish they did not remind\nme of cow-dung\"; Das thought, \"Some Moslems are very violent.\" They\nsmiled wistfully, each spying the thought in the other's heart,\nand Das, the more articulate, said: \"Excuse my mistakes, realize\nmy limitations.

It wriggleth in my tummy.

They arrived early, since it was given in their honour, but\nmost of the Indian guests had arrived even earlier, and stood\nmassed at the farther side of the tennis lawns, doing nothing.\n\n\"It is only just five,\" said Mrs. Turton. \"My husband will be up\nfrom his office in a moment and start the thing. I have no idea\nwhat we have to do. It's the first time we've ever given a party\nlike this at the club. Mr. Heaslop, when I'm dead and gone will\nyou give parties like this?

But he was pleased she had rallied to\nhim and surveyed his mother patronizingly. He had never felt easy\nwith her.", "\n\n\"Would you like that?\"\n\n\"I shan't be here. I'm going to Veronica's.\"\n\n\"You're going to Veronica's?\"\n\n\"Yes, don't you remember?\"\n\nThere were servants in the room so that they said nothing more until\nlater, when they were alone in the library. Then, \"Are you really going\naway?\"", "You will\nhave time to finish it, my friend.\"\n\nFor the first time Tony noticed something slightly menacing in his\nhost's manner. That evening at supper, a brief meal of farine and dried\nbeef, eaten just before sundown, Tony renewed the subject.\n\n\"You know, Mr Todd, the time has come when I must be thinking about\ngetting back to civilization. I have already imposed myself on your\nhospitality far too long.\"\n\nMr Todd bent over the plate, crunching mouthfuls of farine, but made no\nreply.\n\n\"How soon do you think I shall be able to get a boat?... I said, how\nsoon do you think I shall be able to get a boat?", "Could you do me the very great kindness of letting me stop\nafter all?\"\n\nHamidullah swore violently in the vernacular.\n\n\"I should be pleased, but does Mr. Heaslop wish it?\"\n\n\"I didn't ask him, we are too much upset   it's so complex, not like\nwhat unhappiness is supposed to be. Each of us ought to be alone,\nand think. Do come and see Ronny again.\"\n\n\"I think he should come in this time,\" said Fielding, feeling that\nthis much was due to his own dignity. \"Do ask him to come.\"\n\nShe returned with him.", "\n\n\"Oh, lucky you.\"\n\n\"But I want to see them.\"\n\nShe became the centre of an amused group of ladies. One said,\n\"Wanting to see Indians! How new that sounds!\" Another, \"Natives!\nwhy, fancy!\" A third, more serious, said, \"Let me explain.", "You see, the water is running south.\" But almost\nimmediately they crossed a stream flowing in the opposite direction.\n\"Very curious,\" said Dr Messinger. \"A discovery of genuine scientific\nvalue.\"\n\nNext day they waded through four streams at intervals of two miles,\nrunning alternately north and south. The chart began to have a mythical\nappearance.\n\n\"Is there a name for any of these streams?\"", "But he was pleased she had rallied to\nhim and surveyed his mother patronizingly. He had never felt easy\nwith her. She was by no means the dear old lady outsiders supposed,\nand India had brought her into the open.\n\n\"I shall attend your marriage, but not your trial,\" she informed\nthem, tapping her knee; she had become very restless, and rather\nungraceful. \"Then I shall go to England.\"\n\n\"You can't go to England in May, as you agreed.\"\n\n\"I have changed my mind.\"", "\n\n\"I want to do it this afternoon.\"\n\nWhen Tony had left them, Ben said, \"Whatever made you speak to your dad\nlike that for? You've been going on about seeing the kennels since\nChristmas.\"\n\n\"Not with _him_,\" said John.\n\n\"You ungrateful little bastard, that's a lousy way to speak of your\ndad.\"\n\n\"And you ought not to say bastard or lousy in front of me, nanny says\nnot.\"\n\nSo Tony went over alone to Little Bayton, where he had some business to\ndiscuss with Colonel Brink.", "\n\n\"Is he still here?\"\n\n\"No, I told him you'd probably prefer to be left alone. He thought you'd\nbe glad to hear he stopped the hunt.\"\n\n\"Nice of him to come... Were you having a good day?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry. We saw a fox in Bruton Wood last week.", "\n\n\"So George says. He says that the Miss Alans must go to the wall. Yet it\ndoes seem so unkind.\"\n\n\"There is only a certain amount of kindness in the world,\" said George,\nwatching the sunlight flash on the panels of the passing carriages.\n\n\"Yes!\" exclaimed Mrs. Honeychurch. \"That's exactly what I say.", "But she remained standing where she was. \"Do you know where\nI met these desirable tenants? In the National Gallery, when I was up to\nsee my mother last week.\"\n\n\"What an odd place to meet people!\" she said nervously. \"I don't quite\nunderstand.\"\n\n\"In the Umbrian Room.", "Men all go hunting. You give me\ncigarette.\"\n\n\"Listen, Rosa, I want to go to the Pie-wie country.\"\n\n\"No, this Macushi. All the people Macushi.\"\n\n\"But we want to go Pie-wie.\"\n\n\"No, _all_ Macushi. You give me cigarette.\"", "\n\nDr Messinger said nothing, but strained the tea clear of leaves by\npouring it slowly from one mug into another; he stirred into it a large\nspoonful of condensed milk.\n\n\"See if you can drink this.\"\n\nTony drank it with pleasure and ate some biscuits.\n\n\"Are we going on to-day?\" he asked.\n\n\"We'll think about it.\" He took the mugs down to the bank and washed\nthem in the river.", "Do you play tennis? Do you mind\ntennis on Sunday--?\"\n\n\"George mind tennis on Sunday! George, after his education, distinguish\nbetween Sunday--\"\n\n\"Very well, George doesn't mind tennis on Sunday. No more do I. That's\nsettled. Mr. Emerson, if you could come with your son we should be so\npleased.\"\n\nHe thanked her, but the walk sounded rather far; he could only potter\nabout in these days.\n\nShe turned to George: \"And then he wants to give up his house to the\nMiss Alans.\"\n\n\"I know,\" said George, and put his arm round his father's neck.", "\n\n\"Some damn fool said I couldn't speak to you.\"\n\n\"I left a message from where I was dining.

Cecil wondered why Lucy had been amused.\n\n\"I tell you who has no 'fences,' as you call them,\" she said, \"and\nthat's Mr. Beebe.\"\n\n\"A parson fenceless would mean a parson defenceless.\"\n\nLucy was slow to follow what people said, but quick enough to detect\nwhat they meant. She missed Cecil's epigram, but grasped the feeling\nthat prompted it.", "\n\n\"Remember, Lucy, I alone am implicated in this. I do not wish the\nacceptance to come from you. Grant me that, at all events.\"\n\nMr. Beebe was back, saying rather nervously:\n\n\"Mr. Emerson is engaged, but here is his son instead.\"\n\nThe young man gazed down on the three ladies, who felt seated on the\nfloor, so low were their chairs.\n\n\"My father,\" he said, \"is in his bath, so you cannot thank him\npersonally. But any message given by you to me will be given by me to\nhim as soon as he comes out.\"", "\n\n\"Godbole!\"\n\nThe old fellow put his hands together, and looked sly and charming.\n\n\"Is Aziz innocent or guilty?\"\n\n\"That is for the Court to decide. The verdict will be in strict\naccordance with the evidence, I make no doubt.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, but your personal opinion. Here's a man we both like,\ngenerally esteemed; he lives here quietly doing his work. Well,\nwhat's one to make of it?", "The Nawab Bahadur got up in front, for he\nhad no intention of neighbouring an English girl. \"Despite my\nadvanced years, I am learning to drive,\" he said. \"Man can learn\neverything if he will but try.\" And foreseeing a further difficulty,\nhe added, \"I do not do the actual steering. I sit and ask my\nchauffeur questions, and thus learn the reason for everything that\nis done before I do it myself. By this method serious and I may\nsay ludicrous accidents, such as befell one of my compatriots\nduring that delightful reception at the English Club, are avoided.\nOur good Panna Lal! I hope, sahib, that great damage was not done\nto your flowers. Let us have our little spin down the Gangavati\nroad. Half one league onwards!\" He fell asleep.\n\nRonny instructed the chauffeur to take the Marabar road rather than\nthe Gangavati, since the latter was under repair, and settled\nhimself down beside the lady he had lost. The car made a burring\nnoise and rushed along a chauss  e that ran upon an embankment above\nmelancholy fields.", "\n\n\"All right, Ben, you see about it.\"\n\n\"I'll ask thirty, shall I, sir, and come down a bit?\"\n\n\"Do just what you think best.\"\n\n\"Very good, sir.\"\n\n                 *        *        *        *        *\n\nAt luncheon Tony said, \"Jock rang up.

Those words   he had said them to Mrs. Moore in the mosque\nin the beginning of the cycle, from which, after so much suffering,\nhe had got free.

You will see.\"\n\nThat afternoon Mr Todd began the construction of a headpiece for the\nNegro's grave. He worked with a large spoke-shave in a wood so hard that\nit grated and rang like metal.\n\nAt last, when Tony had passed six or seven consecutive nights without\nfever, Mr Todd said, \"Now I think you are well enough to see the books.\"", "He talked for\nfive minutes to Mrs. Blakiston, who was the only surviving female.\nHe talked to McBryde, who was defiant about his divorce, conscious\nthat he had sinned as a sahib. He talked to Major Roberts, the new\nCivil Surgeon; and to young Milner, the new City Magistrate; but\nthe more the club changed, the more it promised to be the same\nthing. \"It is no good,\" he thought, as he returned past the mosque,\n\"we all build upon sand; and the more modern the country gets, the\nworse'll be the crash. In the old eighteenth century, when cruelty\nand injustice raged, an invisible power repaired their ravages.\nEverything echoes now; there's no stopping the echo. The original\nsound may be harmless, but the echo is always evil.\" This reflection\nabout an echo lay at the verge of Fielding's mind. He could never\ndevelop it. It belonged to the universe that he had missed or\nrejected.", "she asked anxiously.\n\n\"Too soon to tell. I'm sure it will be all right.\"\n\n\"She's got the wrong chap. John Andrew's mad about her... quite\nembarrassing.\"\n\n\"I should say Tony was a slow starter. It's a pity she's got his name\nwrong. Ought we to tell her?\"", "It is the chief\npleasure I know. You see, those first six emperors were all most\nwonderful men, and as soon as one of them is mentioned, no matter\nwhich, I forget everything else in the world except the other five.\nYou could not find six such kings in all the countries of the\nearth, not, I mean, coming one after the other   father, son.\"\n\n\"Tell us something about Akbar.\"\n\n\"Ah, you have heard the name of Akbar.

Could any one give me--\"\n\n\"Yes, easily. Jump in. Gracious me, how smart you look! What a lovely\nfrock! You put us all to shame.\"\n\n\"If I did not wear my best rags and tatters now, when should I wear\nthem?\" said Miss Bartlett reproachfully. She got into the victoria and\nplaced herself with her back to the horse.", "\n\n\"I see you're worrying, let's talk of other things,\" he said\nkindly. \"Miss Quested was always to do what she wished, it was our\narrangement. I see you are worrying on my account, but really I\ndon't mind, I never notice trifles.\"\n\n\"I do worry on your account. I consider they have been impolite!\"\nsaid Fielding, lowering his voice. \"She had no right to dash away\nfrom your party, and Miss Derek had no right to abet her.\"\n\nSo touchy as a rule, Aziz was unassailable.", "\n\n\"Lucy, you come and look at the cypresses; and the church, whatever its\nname is, still shows.\"\n\n\"San Miniato. I'll just finish your sock.\"\n\n\"Signorino, domani faremo uno giro,\" called the cabman, with engaging\ncertainty.\n\nGeorge told him that he was mistaken; they had no money to throw away on\ndriving.\n\nAnd the people who had not meant to help--the Miss Lavishes, the Cecils,\nthe Miss Bartletts! Ever prone to magnify Fate, George counted up the\nforces that had swept him into this contentment.", "\n\n\"I must. Mother has taken the tickets.\"\n\n\"Nothing I've said to-night makes any difference?\"\n\n\"Darling, don't go on. We've been through all that. You know it's the\nonly thing that _can_ happen. Why spoil the last week?\"\n\n\"You _have_ enjoyed the summer, haven't you?\"\n\n\"Of course... well, shall we go?\"\n\n\"Yes.", "\nHe was inaccurate because he desired to honour her, and   facts being\nentangled   he had to arrange them in her vicinity, as one tidies\nthe ground after extracting a weed. Before breakfast was over, he\nhad told a good many lies. \"She ran to her friend, I to mine,\" he\nwent on, smiling. \"And now I am with my friends and they are with\nme and each other, which is happiness.\"\n\nLoving them both, he expected them to love each other. They didn't\nwant to. Fielding thought with hostility, \"I knew these women would\nmake trouble,\" and Mrs. Moore thought, \"This man, having missed\nthe train, tries to blame us\"; but her thoughts were feeble; since\nher faintness in the cave she was sunk in apathy and cynicism.", "Later, after their baths, they made up for it in criticism of\nMiss Ripon's father, but at the moment everyone was shocked and silent.\nSomeone lent Jock and Mrs Rattery a car to get home in, and a groom to\nsee to the hirelings.\n\n\"It's the most appalling thing,\" said Jock in the borrowed car. \"What on\nearth are we going to say to Tony?\"\n\n\"I'm the last person to have about on an occasion like this,\" said Mrs\nRattery.\n\nThey passed the scene of the accident; there were still people hanging\nabout, talking.\n\nThere were people hanging about, talking in the hall at the house.", "When she\nspoke she revealed that two of her front teeth were missing.\n\n\"I hope you don't imagine she's coming with us.\"\n\n\"Yes, that the idea,\" said Milly. \"She won't be any trouble--she's got\nher puzzle.\"\n\nTony bent down to speak to the little girl. \"Listen,\" he said. \"You\ndon't want to come to a nasty big hotel.", "But\nshe thought it an admirable idea for Lucy, who hated shopping, changing\nmoney, fetching letters, and other irksome duties--all of which Miss\nBartlett must accomplish this morning and could easily accomplish alone.\n\n\"No, Charlotte!\" cried the girl, with real warmth. \"It's very kind of\nMr. Beebe, but I am certainly coming with you. I had much rather.\"\n\n\"Very well, dear,\" said Miss Bartlett, with a faint flush of pleasure\nthat called forth a deep flush of shame on the cheeks of Lucy.

Boats finish just now.\"\n\nAt last when it was clear that the work was nearly complete, Dr\nMessinger busied himself with arrangements. He sorted out the stores,\ndividing the necessary freight into two groups; he and Tony were to sit\nin separate boats and each had with him a rifle and ammunition, a\ncamera, tinned rations, trade goods and his own luggage.

Doors shut; indeed, most necessary. No one\nhas the least idea of privacy in this country. And one person catches it\nfrom another.\"\n\nLucy answered suitably. Mr. Beebe was not able to tell the ladies of\nhis adventure at Modena, where the chambermaid burst in upon him in his\nbath, exclaiming cheerfully, \"Fa niente, sono vecchia.\" He contented\nhimself with saying: \"I quite agree with you, Miss Alan.", "He heard her in\nsilence, and then said: \"My dear, I am worried about you. It seems to\nme\"--dreamily; she was not alarmed--\"that you are in a muddle.\"\n\nShe shook her head.\n\n\"Take an old man's word; there's nothing worse than a muddle in all the\nworld. It is easy to face Death and Fate, and the things that sound\nso dreadful. It is on my muddles that I look back with horror--on the\nthings that I might have avoided. We can help one another but little. I\nused to think I could teach young people the whole of life, but I know\nbetter now, and all my teaching of George has come down to this: beware\nof muddle. Do you remember in that church, when you pretended to be\nannoyed with me and weren't? Do you remember before, when you refused\nthe room with the view? Those were muddles--little, but ominous--and I\nam fearing that you are in one now.\" She was silent. \"Don't trust me,\nMiss Honeychurch. Though life is very glorious, it is difficult.\"", "\n\n\"Not yet.\"\n\nHis own content was absolute, but hers held bitterness: the\nHoneychurches had not forgiven them; they were disgusted at her past\nhypocrisy; she had alienated Windy Corner, perhaps for ever.\n\n\"What does he say?\"\n\n\"Silly boy! He thinks he's being dignified. He knew we should go off in\nthe spring--he has known it for six months--that if mother wouldn't give\nher consent we should take the thing into our own hands. They had fair\nwarning, and now he calls it an elopement. Ridiculous boy--\"\n\n\"Signorino, domani faremo uno giro--\"\n\n\"But it will all come right in the end. He has to build us both up\nfrom the beginning again. I wish, though, that Cecil had not turned so\ncynical about women. He has, for the second time, quite altered.", "The dear George, now striding towards them\nover the tombstones, seemed both pitiable and absurd. He approached, his\nface in the shadow. He said:\n\n\"Miss Bartlett.\"\n\n\"Oh, good gracious me!\" said Lucy, suddenly collapsing and again seeing\nthe whole of life in a new perspective. \"Where? Where?\"", "Now that I'm\ngoing, I realize it. I wish I could do something for you in return,\nbut I see you've all you want.\"\n\n\"I think so,\" he replied after a pause. \"I have never felt more\nhappy and secure out here. I really do get on with Indians, and\nthey do trust me. It's pleasant that I haven't had to resign my\njob. It's pleasant to be praised by an L.-G.

After that, he watched the semi-chivalrous behavings\nof the three English with quiet amusement; he thought Fielding had\nbeen incredibly silly and weak, and he was amazed by the younger\npeople's want of proper pride. When they were driving out to\nDilkusha, hours late, he said to Amritrao, who accompanied them:\n\"Mr. Amritrao, have you considered what sum Miss Quested ought to\npay as compensation?\"\n\n\"Twenty thousand rupees.\"\n\nNo more was then said, but the remark horrified Fielding.

It's all too horrible.\"\n\n\"What's the good of a scene?\"", "Where's my mother?\"\n\n\"Good evening!\" she replied coolly.\n\n\"I want you and mother at once. There's to be polo.\"\n\n\"I thought there was to be no polo.\"\n\n\"Everything's altered. Some soldier men have come in.", "\n\n\"I get depressed down here all alone and imagine things.\"\n\n\"You aren't to _brood_, Tony. You know that's one of the things that\naren't allowed.\"\n\n\"I won't brood any more,\" said Tony.\n\nNext day Brenda came to church with him. She had decided to devote the\nweek-end wholly to him; it would be the last for some time.\n\n\"And how are the abstruse sciences, Lady Brenda?\"", "How would you like\nspinsters?\"\n\n\"My dear Lucy, it would be splendid. Do you know any such?\"\n\n\"Yes; I met them abroad.\"\n\n\"Gentlewomen?\" he asked tentatively.\n\n\"Yes, indeed, and at the present moment homeless.", "\n\n\"Then why not say so at once, instead of considering half an hour?\"\n\nShe laughed faintly, \"Half a minute would be nearer.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you would like to stay away from your home altogether?\"\n\n\"Hush, mother! People will hear you\"; for they had entered Mudie's. She\nbought Baedeker, and then continued: \"Of course I want to live at home;\nbut as we are talking about it, I may as well say that I shall want to\nbe away in the future more than I have been. You see, I come into my\nmoney next year.\"\n\nTears came into her mother's eyes.", "\n\nDr Messinger pointed to the load which the second nigger had laid on the\nground.\n\n\"Give me,\" she said.\n\n\"When men come back, I give you plenty things if men come with me to\nPie-wies.\"\n\n\"No, _all_ Macushi here.\"\n\n\"We aren't doing any good,\" said Dr Messinger. \"We'd better go back to\ncamp and wait. The men have been away three days.", "Broke a fruit gum\nmachine.\"\n\n\"Reggie was stinking.\"\n\n\"I say, you don't still feel low about that girl?\"\n\n\"I don't feel low.\"\n\n\"Come on, we'll go downstairs.\"\n\nThe dance-room was fairly full. An elderly man had joined the band and\nwas trying to conduct it. \"", "\n\nShe did not. Nor did it seem applicable to a young man who had spent a\nquiet winter in Rome with his mother. But Cecil, since his engagement,\nhad taken to affect a cosmopolitan naughtiness which he was far from\npossessing.\n\n\"Well,\" said he, \"I cannot help it if they do disapprove of me. There\nare certain irremovable barriers between myself and them, and I must\naccept them.\"\n\n\"We all have our limitations, I suppose,\" said wise Lucy.\n\n\"Sometimes they are forced on us, though,\" said Cecil, who saw from her\nremark that she did not quite understand his position.", "I shall go back to the College now. If you want me,\nring me up; if you don't, don't, for I shall be very busy.\"\n\n\"Good-bye, my dear Fielding, and you actually are on our side\nagainst your own people?\"\n\n\"Yes. Definitely.\"\n\nHe regretted taking sides. To slink through India unlabelled was\nhis aim. Henceforward he would be called \"anti-British,\"\n\"seditious\"   terms that bored him, and diminished his utility.", "\n\n\"Perhaps we ought to send Miss Honeychurch down to her mother. Or will\nshe come with us?\"\n\n\"I think we had better leave Lucy to herself, and to her own pursuits.\"\n\n\"They're angry with Miss Honeychurch because she was late for\nbreakfast,\" whispered Minnie, \"and Floyd has gone, and Mr. Vyse has\ngone, and Freddy won't play with me. In fact, Uncle Arthur, the house is\nnot AT ALL what it was yesterday.\"\n\n\"Don't be a prig,\" said her Uncle Arthur. \"Go and put on your boots.\"", "Just what I remember. He seems to see\ngood in everyone. No one would take him for a clergyman.\"\n\n\"My dear Lucia--\"\n\n\"Well, you know what I mean. And you know how clergymen generally laugh;\nMr. Beebe laughs just like an ordinary man.\"\n\n\"Funny girl! How you do remind me of your mother.", "He's getting very restive. I have to feed him\na bit of high-life every week or so, and I suppose that'll all stop if\nthere's a divorce. Any news of Tony?\"\n\n\"Not for some time now. I got a cable when he landed. He's gone off on\nsome expedition with a crook doctor.\"\n\n\"Is it _absolutely_ safe?\"\n\n\"Oh, I imagine so. The whole world is civilized now, isn't\nit--charabancs and Cook's offices everywhere.\"", "\n\n\"To such a remark there is certainly no reply,\" said Hamidullah,\nmoved. Recovering himself and smiling, he said: \"Have you heard\nthis naughty rumour that Mohammed Latif has got hold of?\"\n\n\"Which?\"\n\n\"When Miss Quested stopped in the College, Fielding used to visit\nher . . . rather too late in the evening, the servants say.\"\n\n\"A pleasant change for her if he did,\" said Aziz, making a curious\nface.\n\n\"But you understand my meaning?\"\n\nThe young man winked again and said: \"Just!", "She stopped and leant her elbows\nagainst the parapet of the embankment. He did likewise. There is at\ntimes a magic in identity of position; it is one of the things that have\nsuggested to us eternal comradeship. She moved her elbows before saying:\n\n\"I have behaved ridiculously.\"\n\nHe was following his own thoughts.\n\n\"I was never so much ashamed of myself in my life; I cannot think what\ncame over me.\"\n\n\"I nearly fainted myself,\" he said; but she felt that her attitude\nrepelled him.", "Listen to the wind among the pines! Yours is a glorious\ncountry.\"\n\nMr. Beebe came to the rescue.\n\n\"Mr. Emerson, he will call, I shall call; you or your son will return\nour calls before ten days have elapsed. I trust that you have realized\nabout the ten days' interval. It does not count that I helped you with\nthe stair-eyes yesterday. It does not count that they are going to bathe\nthis afternoon.\"\n\n\"Yes, go and bathe, George. Why do you dawdle talking?
